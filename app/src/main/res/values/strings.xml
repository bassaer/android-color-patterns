        Breakfast is the first meal of a day,
        most often eaten in the early morning before undertaking the day\'s work.\n\n
        The word in English refers to breaking the fasting period of the prior night.
        There is a strong tendency for one or more "typical", or "traditional",
        breakfast menus to exist in most places,
        but the composition of this varies widely from place to place,
        and has varied over time,
        so that globally a very wide range of preparations and ingredients are now associated with breakfast.
